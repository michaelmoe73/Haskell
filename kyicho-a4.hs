# Assignment 4 COMP 3007 Fall 2015

Due: 23:55 Wed Sep 30 2015

**What to submit.** Submit this Haskell file with the questions
completed.

**Collaboration policy.** Collaborating on assignments is STRICTLY
DISALLOWED. You must complete the work by yourself. If you need
help, please see a TA or your instructor. Posting assignment
solutions on discussion boards before the due date and time is also
prohibited.

**What you can use.** In this assignment, you can use anything from
the lectures, the given Haskell file (including what's imported) and
anything in the Prelude.  Nothing more though.  The first two import
lines at the beginning of the file can be ignored.  They're just for
the parser.  The next two are useful but you don't need to use them.

**Debugging.** You might find the debugger useful.  It's imported
above. It's quite easy to use the basic tracing facility. See the
Haskell Hierarchical Libraries documentation for info on how to use
it:

https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/

The assignment is to implement the evaluator for the language L
discussed in class.  You should review the notes from that class.
There is also a complete description of the language in this file.

## Description of L

Here is the description of L that was discussed in the Wed Sept 23
lecture.

Expressions (abstract and concrete syntax):

%x.e  -- lambda abstraction, like \x->e in Haskell
e e'  -- application
x,y,z -- variables
succ, pred, ifzero, 0, 1, 2....

Values:

0, 1, 2, 3,...
%x.e
succ, pred, ifzero
ifzero e
ifzero e e


Evaluation: e ==> v means e evaluates to value v.  The rules below
specify how to evaluate.

For an algorithmic view, you can read the rules bottom-up.  E.g. the
second rule can be read as saying that to evaluate an application
expression e e', first evaluate e, and if you get a value of the form
%x.b, continue by evaluating b[e'/x], and if that results in a value
v, return that as the result of evaluating e e'.

There's a more algorithmic presentation of evaluation in the lectures
notes.  There are a few small differences, so please use the
definition below as the specification for your evaluator.


-------
v ==> v

e ==> %x.b  b[e'/x] ==> v   (b[e'/x] is substitution of e' for x in b)
-------------------------
e e' ==> v

e ==> succ e' ==> n  m=n+1
--------------------------
e e' ==> m

e ==> pred e' ==> n  m=max(n-1,0)
---------------------------------
e e' ==> m

e ==> ifzero
------------------
e e' ==> ifzero e'

e ==> ifzero eb
---------------------
e e' ==> ifzero eb e'

e ==> ifzero eb et  eb ==> 0  et ==> v
--------------------------------------
e e' ==> v

e ==> ifzero eb et  eb ==> u  u \= 0  e' ==> v
-----------------------------------------------
e e' ==> v

Here is an example of how to derive an evaluation fact.

## Example evaluation

Write s for succ

%x.s x ==> %x.s x
(%f.%x.f x) ==> (%f.%x.f x)    s ==> s  3 ==> 3  4=3+1
---------------------------   ------------------------
(%f.%x.f x) s ==> %x.s x          s 3 ==> 4
-------------------------------------------
(%f.%x.f x) s 3 ==> 4


## The Y combinator

The language L may not seem so far to have a way of defining functions
recursively.  However, it does.  The key is the following expression,
which we'll call Y:

   %f. (%x. f (x x)) (%x. f (x x))

Don't try to figure out what it means.  All that matters it how it
behaves when you compute with it.  

Suppose F is some other expression.  By considering evaluation steps,
we can see that the following equalities hold, if by "equal" we mean
that the equal things always compute to the same values no matter how
they're used.  The first step below is applying the function Y to its
one argument, and this means plugging F in for f in the body of the %
expression (%f.  ...).  The second step is one more application step,
and the last step is just using the reverse of the first step
(replacing a bigger term by YF).

Y F = (%x. F (x x)) (%x. F (x x))
    = F ((%x. F (x x)) (%x. F (x x)))
    = F (Y F)

The equality we get, Y F = F (Y F), is the key thing.  You don't
really need to understanding anything at all about Y other than this
fact.  

Let's see how this fact can be used to do recursion, by using a simple
example.

Suppose we actually were able to do recursive definitions in L.  The
definition of factorial could look something like this.

   fact = %n. ifzero n 1 (times n (fact (pred n)))

However, we can rewrite the above as follows:

   fact  =  (%f. %n. ifzero n 1 (times n (f (pred n))))  fact

All we've done is introduce an anonymous function of one argument
that when applied to fact gives us the original right-hand-side of
the defintion.  Let's give a name to this anonymous function just for
reference:

   F = %f. %n. ifzero n 1 (times n (f (pred n)))

Using this name instead of the term, the last equation for fact above
becomes 

  fact = F fact

Let's look at what Y F does for this F.  Let's apply it to 3 and
see what that's equal to.

Y F 3 = 
F (Y F) 3 =
(%n. ifzero n 1 (times n ((Y F) (pred n)))) 3 =
ifzero 3 1 (times 3 ((Y F) (pred 3))) =
times 3 ((Y F) (pred 3)) =
times 3 ((Y F) 2)

We can do the same thing with (Y F) 2.

(Y F) 2 =
F (Y F) 2 =
(%n. ifzero n 1 (times n ((Y F) (pred n)))) 2 =
times 2 ((Y F) 1)

Putting the above results together, we have

   (Y F) 3 = times 3 (times 2 ((Y F) 1))

Continuing in this way, we get

   (Y F) 3 = times 3 (times 2 (times 1 ((Y F) 0)))
           = times 3 (times 2 (times 1 1))
           = 6 

In conclusion, (Y F) for this F behaves just like we want fact to.

## Abstract Syntax of L

This is the representation of L you will be working with.  

-}

-- Identifiers for % expressions and variables
type Id = String

-- The "builtin" functions.
data Op = Succ | Pred | IfZero
           deriving (Show, Ord, Eq)

-- Expressions of L
data Exp = Var Id
         | Nat Integer
         | Op Op
         | Lam Id Exp
         | App Exp Exp
           deriving (Ord, Eq, Show)

-- "Pretty printer" for expressions.  You can override the Show method
-- for Exp using it if you like.  The instance declaration is below
-- (don't forget to remove Show from the "deriving" clause for Exp).
pp :: Exp -> String
pp (Var s) = s
pp (Nat n) = show n
pp (Op Succ) = "succ"
pp (Op Pred) = "pred"
pp (Op IfZero) = "ifzero"
pp (Lam x e) = "%" ++ x ++ "." ++ pp e
pp (App e e') = paren_fun e ++ " " ++ paren_arg e'
  where paren_fun e@(Lam _ _) = paren $ pp e
        paren_fun e = pp e
        paren_arg e@(App _ _) = paren $ pp e
        paren_arg e@(Lam _ _) = paren $ pp e
        paren_arg e = pp e
        paren s = "(" ++ s ++ ")"

-- instance Show Exp where
--   show = pp


{-

## Concrete Syntax of L

Reminder: iterated applications ((m n1) n2) ... can be written without
the parens, i.e. m n1 n2.... However, %-abstractions must be written
separately, e.g. "%x y. x y" is not allowed, it has to be written
"%x.%y. x y".

You don't need to know anything about this section except that
there is a function

  parse :: String -> Exp

that converts the usual representation (as we used in class) into
Exp.  For example:

   parse "%f. f 1 2" =
   Lam "f" App (App (Var "f") (Nat 1)) (Nat 2)

The parser is written using the imported "monadic parsing combinator"
library.

-- QUESTION 1: 25 pts
--
-- subst x e e': substitute e for all "free" occurrences of (Var x) in
-- e'.  "Free" means that the variable it is not declared by a
-- surrounding %.  For example, in the expression
--
-- x (%x. x (%y.xz)) (%y.x)

-- there are 5 occurrences of x.  The first is "free".  The second is
-- the parameter for the % expression and is never substituted for.
-- The third and fourth occurrences refer to the parameter of the
-- enclosing % expression.  The fifth is free.  Therefore if we
-- substitute 0 for x we get 0 (%x. x (%y.xz)) (%y.0)

The rest of the examples involve recursion based on the Y
combinator.  If your evaluator works on the above, it will likely
work on the examples below.  However, if it doesn't, it might not
be so easy to debug.   The Debug.Trace module is handy.  In any
case, if your evaluator only works on the above examples, you will
receive goodly partial credit.
